Towards the very end of the month I scrapped the app so far and started over in
the spirit of 'build one to throw away'. The previous version had built up some
serious technical debt and did not leverage certain frameworks (read: react) that
greatly ease the front-end process.

## Tasks Completed

* moved old master to new branch
* created new branch
* can draw nodes and pins


## Tasks to be done in next report

* Everything

## Risks, Concerns and Problems

* Have to step up production speed with the rewrite, however the app will be scalable and able to handle much more things. Overall, much much much more robust.

## Additional Comments

* None to report
