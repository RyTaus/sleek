The last report. Overall I had a great time doing this project which had many ups
and a few downs. I am happy with the product, however I wish I had a bit more time
to add in a couple more features that would really increase the quality of the app.
I am planning on continuing this as a personal project and they will definitely get in someday.

## Tasks Completed

* dynamic type checking
* functions
* UI pass
* passing down changes in functions
* on screen console
* code generation
* interaction
* context menu for actions
* node searcher
* expanded library


## Tasks to be done in next report

* there is none...

## Risks, Concerns and Problems
Again, I wish I had a bit more time, but I am very happy with this as a prototype.
This project was always ambitious scale wise and I hope I can shape it into what
I wanted in the coming months. 

## Additional Comments

* None to report
